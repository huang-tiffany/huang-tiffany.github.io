			<em>Title: </em>Self-Portrait Series <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2021 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>36" &times; 72", 36" &times; 24" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Water, Compressed Charcoal <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			The final project for my freshman fall semester drawing class asked us to continue exploring a previous subject area and medium that interested us. After drawing self-portraits for the first time and learning to work with wet charcoal, I use this assignment to explore the ways in which I see myself, both within and without.

			<em>Medium: </em>Vine Charcoal, White Charcoal, Compressed Charcoal <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Whether as a girl or as a ballerina, the struggle with one’s body-image has become increasingly problematic as people of all backgrounds view their features in a negative light. Here, the combination of the human form with both interior and exterior elements (the room inside of the bent-over figure and the mountains transforming from her legs and drapery, respectively) highlights not only the beauty of the human body, but its universality in the design we create and the nature we observe.

			<em>Title: </em>Telephone <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2022 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>11" &times; 17" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Procreate, Adobe Illustrator <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			After brainstorming ideas around the telephone and its cultural significance, I created a poster reimagining the princess telephone as a seesaw on which a person and his childhood self hold a conversation about their future. By playing the game of telephone with myself, I reinterpreted my original writing about my internal sentiments about the future as they disintegrated into undiscernable bits of consciousness, also thinking about the way people tend to distance themselves from their childhood selves and dreams over time.

			<em>Size: </em>8.5" &times; 11" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			As the Creative Director for Brown's Rogue Fashion Magazine, I worked with other members of Rogue's executive board to gather content for the culminating publication of the year's activities and designed the magazine from scratch as the sole graphic designer. Collaborating with an editorial team to gather stories about up-and-coming student designers at RISD, I took charge of creating layouts and compositions to assemble a booklet, later printed as physical copies that the club distributed among staff members and the featured designers.

			<em>Title: </em>Caught <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2021 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>17" &times; 11" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Lighter, Bristol Paper, Laser Cutter, Google Translate, Adobe Illustrator <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			The text, which I ran through Google Translate 100 times and substituted some Chinese words back in to further push the writing towards complete gibberish, is composed of an essay I wrote on bilingualism; by rastering it onto the paper with a laser cutter and then lightly charring the paper with a lighter, I blurred together the text and erased some of it with the flame, relating it to the struggles of being bilingual and a second-generation immigrant in the way that one cannot be truly fluent in either language they speak. By physically and chemically altering the paper with the laser cutter and lighter as well, the piece’s development over time also symbolizes the gradual changes to the speaker’s fluency in either language.

			<em>Medium: </em>Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Although many people think of their adolescent years as ones to forget or to erase due to their embarrassing memories, they often forget how important their childhood and teenage years were for their development. This magazine, which contains an assortment of photography and writing samples from the formative years of a collection of young adults, attempts to change the perspective of teens on the past.

			<em>Year: </em>2021 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>18" &times; 12" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Over the 2021-2022 school year, I acted as the Editor-in-Chief for the Saratoga High School yearbook, overseeing a staff of 22, creating style guides and templates, designing, and editing layouts. Our theme for the year, "Still Life," speaks to the experiences we underwent as high school students in a year of COVID: whether through appreciating every day objects more as if we were still life artists, realizing that life has frozen and become still, or discovering that no matter what happens it's "still life."

		<p class="ramenhead hidden project-description">
			<em>Title: </em>Ramenhead <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2020 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>12" &times; 12" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			With the arts typically being associated with self-expression, I wanted to find new avenues through which self-care and healing can be expressed through music. Inspired by the feelings associated with comfort food—ramen in particular—I wanted to create a musical manifestation of self-care with colorful graphics and a song menu that carry out the theme of nutrition.

		<p class="e11h-zine hidden project-description">
			<em>Title: </em>The Asian American Dream Zine <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2020 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>8.5" &times; 5.5" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			As Asian Americans, our experiences are often underrepresented in the classic literature we read in our English classes. By creating this zine with my friend, and acting as the artistic director and sole designer, I wanted to diversify the American Dream that we read about in our junior year curriculum of The Great Gatsby, synthesizing my friend’s and my writing and our photography with quotes from books about storytelling (<em>The Things They Carried</em>) and the American Dream (<em>The Great Gatsby</em>).

			<em>Year: </em>2020 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>11" &times; 8.5" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Adobe InDesign <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Combining my interest in the human form with the rich history associated with depictions of human figures throughout various artistic movements from prehistoric to Modern, I designed a magazine to synthesize my knowledge on one of the most important subjects in art history. Created in the span of about a week, I wrote essays, curated pieces, and designed layouts for the most iconic works I studied in AP Art History.

			&mdash;<br>
			From another Calarts course that I took over the past summer, which focused on app design, I learned to prototype interfaces with regards to handheld devices. While many apps do allow for virtual journaling, they often sacrifice the authenticity and craft of bullet journaling for sleek interfaces; thus, I wanted to digitize bullet journaling while keeping the same aesthetics, colors, and patterns typically associated with the activity.

			&mdash;<br>
			Over the summer, one of the online courses I took was one from Calarts, which focused on web design. In this class, I learned the stages of creating a website while simultaneously designing my own fictional restaurant, prototypes, and graphics. In this piece, my restaurant RingRamen upgrades traditional instant ramen by adding authentic and high-quality ingredients that can be found in more refined ramen shops while minimizing cost. By creating this interface, I hoped to simulate what the business’s website could look like, experimenting with Adobe UX in creating a final usable prototype that recreates the experience of ordering from and learning about RingRamen.

			<em>Size: </em>11" &times; 8.5" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Adobe InDesign, Adobe Dimension, Adobe Illustrator <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Inspired by one of my previous works that consisted of an interactive exhibition where participants send letters to their past and future selves, I created a brand development guide for a fictional company Self-Sent, which would have a similar purpose of functioning as a messaging platform where customers can send in letters to the past and future using a variety of branded packages. In this guide, I included logo and typography-branding design choices, product design, and initial business planning.

			<em>Title: </em>The Sky in Boxes <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2022 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>2" &times; 9" &times; 3"<br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Acrylic, Laser Cutter, Printed Acetate, Newsprint, Mirrored Acrylic, Found Objects <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			As the end of the semester drew to a close, I was considering many of the same ideas as I was in <em>(M)issing</em>, thinking about treasuring each day with my friends as if it were the last. Treating each box as a container of the sky and memories related to a particular day I wanted to remember, the three boxes hold journal entries, accordion books of photos taken that day, and found objects relating to my memories as a way of relating some of my happiest days to physical forms.
		</p>
		<p class="missing hidden project-description">
			<em>Title: </em>(M)issing <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2022 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>4" &times; 10" &times; 2" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Birch Plywood, Laser Cutter, Printed Acetate, Bristol Paper, Plexiglass Rod, LEDs, BluTack, Adobe Illustrator <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			After hearing that one of my best friends at RISD was considering transferring to another university, I began to worry over the idea that every day that I spent with them would be one of the last of my life. This project documents five days that I spent with them, turning them into tiny lanterns with fiber optics so they allow the possessor to hold the sky in their palms.

		<p class="ribcage hidden project-description">
			<em>Title: </em>"I AM HERE." <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2022 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>18" &times; 12" &times; 12" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Air-Dry Clay, Wire, Fishing Line, Acrylic Paint, Plexiglass Rod <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Starting in prehistoric times, as evidenced by the caves of Lascaux, humans have always wanted to leave a mark, as if to announce, "I am here." Even as children, our first experiences tend to center around finger-painting and Play-Doh, exemplifying the centrality of finger markmaking to the human experience. Using my fingers, I painted each rib, emphasizing the idea of the fingerprint as a mark in addition to the way my hands have sculpted the ribcage. With each rib ending in a miniature hand, the ribcage plays with surrealism and touch as a concept, as viewers imagine the ribcage initiating a hug of its own as well.

		<p class="beans hidden project-description">
			<em>Title: </em>Belonging <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2021 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>3" &times; 5" &times; 3"<br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Bristol Paper, Tracing Paper, Wood, Wire, Muslin, Magnets <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Despite their obvious differences on the outside, the two figures in the sculpture still fit together smoothly within, representing a moment of epiphany and connection described in Clarice Lispector's "Belonging." The ability of the viewer to easily pull apart and piece together the two figures because of the magnets embedded inside them also relates to how such moments of pure belonging are fleeting; nevertheless, given that the two figures can fit together in a way that suggests another complete form, and because of the magnets that draw them together, the piece suggests the innately human desire to reach out to others and the importance of connection—whether with language or not—to one’s identity. Lastly, the two figures’ relationship to each other as companions also relates to the idea of translation, language, and connection, as such ideas can only exist between two or more people.

		<p class="baby-gun hidden project-description">
			<em>Title: </em>B(a)b(y) Gun <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2021 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>8" &times; 12" &times; 3"<br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Baby Bottle, Mini Plastic Babies, Pregnancy Tests, Pipette, Hairdryer <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			With the current state of society, people are becoming more and more hesitant to have kids, worrying about the consequences of bringing a child into a world that has less and less to offer them. Through the almost-absurd juxtaposition of babies, which represent life, and guns, which symbolize death, I wanted to explore how the traditionally honorable act of bringing new life into the world simultaneously doubles as a decreasingly promising future for later generations.
		</p>
		<p class="yo-soy hidden project-description">
			<em>Title: </em>Yo Soy <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2020 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>4" &times; 3" &times; 3" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Soy Sauce Bottle, Light Bulb Base, LED <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			For years, I was ashamed of being an Asian American, as many of my peers were; all I wanted to be was completely Westernized. But after beginning to learn about my own culture, as well as other world cultures through my Spanish classes, I now realize that cultural identity is not only something to accept, but something to champion. The title of the piece—which means "I Am" in Spanish—both represents my synthesis of the three languages I speak (English, Chinese, and Spanish) and my own punny way of using language to connect with others.

		<p class="cd-burger hidden project-description">
			<em>Title: </em>Instant (cont.) <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2020 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>4" &times; 12" &times; 10"<br>
			<em>Medium: </em>CD, Big Mac, Wrapper <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			As musicians continue to churn out music with an emphasis on quantity over quality, mainstream music slowly loses its artistic meaning as artists continue to add music videos on YouTube, but ultimately contribute no underlying message through their work, regardless of how many people they may hire to assist in the production of their albums.
		</p>
		<p class="instant hidden project-description">
			<em>Title: </em>Instant <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2020 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>80" &times; 34" &times; 22" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>CDs, CD Cases, Plastic Bag, Paper Bag, Packaging, Chex Mix, Ramen, Mac 'n' Cheese, Donut, Popcorn, Acetate, Plastic Tube <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Nowadays, the music industry has turned art into business. Pop songs have become manufactured, new ones pumped out every few days with the same chord progressions, beats, and basic themes. Through experimentation with unconventional materials such as junk food and packaging, this suspended installation argues that just like instant food, many artists have begun to settle for quantity over quality.

			<em>Size: </em>11" &times; 6" &times; 4" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Shoeboxes, Plants, Dirt, CDs <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Human beings’ lack of ability to communicate their true emotions often bars them from reaching complete vulnerability with others. By growing the vines myself, I wanted to exemplify the universal desire to reach out to the people around me, regardless of whatever barriers may hinder humans’ abilities to communicate their inner thoughts.

		<p class="disconnect hidden project-description">
			<em>Title: </em>Disconnect <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2020 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>32" &times; 40" &times; 18" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Suspended and Cut Vellum, String, LEDs <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			As a trilingual Asian American, sometimes I still feel like it’s difficult to express myself. Neither completely knowledgeable about American culture nor completely fluent in Chinese, I always feel stuck in between the two worlds as an entity both a part of and separate from each one.

		<p class="stardust hidden project-description">

			<em>Year: </em>2019-2020 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>65" &times; 30" &times; 38" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Origami Stars, Self <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			There’s a legend that says folding 10,000 stars grants you a wish, but when fate separates you from your passion, often a wish isn’t enough.

		<p class="parasol hidden project-description">
			<em>Title: </em>The Most Beautiful Moment in Life <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2020 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>42" &times; 36" &times; 36" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Paper Parasol, Fencing Wire, Plants and Flower Petals, Tree Branch <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			When watching cherry blossoms fall, our first reactions are to snip off a few buds to keep for ourselves. In the same way, whenever we experience happy moments, we instinctively reach for our phones to take a photo and preserve the moment, though we know it will pass. Rather than trapping branches under fences to prevent their petals from being blown away (represented by the fence insert in the parasol), I wanted to remind both myself and others to stand under the umbrella and enjoy the moments for what they are.

			<em>Medium: </em>Poplar Plywood, Dowels, Wood Glue, Acrylic Plexiglass, Screws, Arduino, LED Light Strips, Portable Chargers, Light Sensors <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Comprised of two stools that fit together to form a bench, the Synergy Seats bridge physical and emotional distances within a shared space to create connections between two seated individuals. As one person sits down, the other seat lights up so that when two people are seated, the entire bench is illuminated to visualize a connection and foster interaction and cohabitation of a space.

			<em>Size: </em>8" &times; 8" &times; 8"<br>
			<em>Medium: </em> Acrylic Plexliglass, Spray Paint, Elastic Thread, Arduino <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			The ATD Imaging Helm acts as a tool for architects and marketers to track the way users navigate spaces and where they look most often to design more accessible buildings and marketing platforms within spaces.

			<em>Size: </em>8" &times; 8" &times; 3" per Platform <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Cardboard, Adobe Illustrator, Laser Cutter <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Inspired by the perforated layering of bird bones, the wearable takes advantage of the holes’ benefits of being both lightweight and resistant to pressure and applies them to the human body in making a buoyant product that can absorb steady impact.

		<p class="gmgn hidden project-description">
			<em>Title: </em>Good Morning, Good Night <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2022 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>18" &times; 8" &times; 8" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Cardboard, Light Bulb, Thread, Laser Cutter, Hot Glue <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			<em>Good Morning, Good Night</em> acts as both a divider and connector of spaces. Acting as a centerpiece for a table for two, the product blocks the companions' views of each other when the blinds are down; when one needs light, they open the blinds, allowing the pair to check in on each other and share the space when both blinds are open.

			<em>Title: </em>Cardboard Luxury Handbag <br>

			<em>Size: </em>8.5" &times; 8.5" &times; 2" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Cardboard, Laser Cutter, Hot Glue, Sobo Glue <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			With this take on the cardboard bag, I wanted to experiment with how visual cues can disguise a material. By printing the Louis Vuitton pattern (appropriated with my initials) on the bag and turning it into a saddlebag, I wanted to hide the cheapness of the material with visual associations.
		</p>
		<p class="clutch hidden project-description">
			<em>Title: </em>Cardboard Woven Clutch <br>

			<em>Size: </em>5" &times; 8" &times; 3" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Cardboard, Sobo Glue, Magnets, Thread <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Weaving cardboard into a flexible fabric of sorts allows for cardboard to be completely transformed from an inflexible substance into a malleable one; by playing with the material itself, I wanted to experiment with how different techniques could completely alter cardboard's properties to become something more fashionable and high-quality.

			<em>Medium: </em>Drawstring Bag, Hot Glue, String <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			As someone that likes to take her time when drinking milk tea, carrying the cup while walking around with friends or doing other activities becomes a hassle because I always have to worry about spilling or not having enough hands to carry other items. As a result, I decided to design a cupholder specifically made for milk tea or coffee that would make my life easier and allow me to keep my hands free.

			<em>Medium: </em>Foamcore, Cloth, Paper, Fake Dirt, Acetate, Balsa Wood, Paint, Straws <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			This project served to create a healing center for a children's hospital with the theme of "refreshing." With aquatic elements, a koi pond, an art room, a gardening room, the center provides space for recreation while a sunroom sets up a shared space for conversation and interaction. Near the entrance of the center, private rooms also allow for personal reflection and meditation.

			<em>Title: </em>Seven Minutes in Heaven <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2022 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>72" &times; 84" &times; 36" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Glass, Galaxy Projector Light, Closets, Found Glass, Thread, Butcher Paper, Wood <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			After reading Philip Fisher's <em>Wonder, the Rainbow, and the Aesthetics of Rare Experiences</em>, I was interested in creating wonder in a mundane space. By creating a site-specific installation in my dorm room closets, I asked pairs of people to sit together in the same space for seven minutes, referencing the popular adolescent game Seven Minutes in Heaven, after confiscating their phones in an attempt to promote interaction.
			<br><br>
			The shared space seats two people due to how it was created by rearranging the two closets; after hot-casting a glass arch and splitting it in half to act as a lens for a galaxy projector light, I filled the space with a deep blue color and green particles. In addition to the light, I also hung broken pieces of found glass from hooks on the closet walls to further reflect the light and add to the atmosphere.
			<br><br>
			By inhabiting a familiar—yet unfamiliar, due to the wondrous atmospheric presence of the glass and light—space together for seven minutes, visitors of the installation are invited to overcome the awkwardness of being alone together without any distractions, nurturing conversation and interaction in a modern era where humans prefer to avoid complete vulnerability via their phones.

			&mdash;<br>
			This computer program uses code to transform movement (recorded via the webcam) of one’s eyes into a visual record that allows people to draw with their eyes. Created in p5.js, I was primarily interested in how movement and movement tracking could be used to create visual art and was inspired by EUPHRATES's "Ballet Rotoscope."

			&mdash;<br>
			While taking AP Computer Science this semester, our final open-ended project led me to write code that could create unique visual “fingerprints” for inputted music. By assigning specific colors—taken from composer Scriabin’s color keyboard—to set wavelengths and coordinating a growing set of rings to wrap around a shape created by the MP3's FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) frequency waves, I wanted to reinterpret music as a visual experience.

			This poster contains fingerprints created by the Visualizer from music across various genres, the first being my own original composition. Based off of the selected pieces—such as Clair de Lune’s neat concentric circles or the unique coloration and chaotic shape of “Spring Day” due to the heavy use of synthesizers—Music Visualizer acts as a reflection not only of the music’s frequencies, but also of its texture and overarching characteristics in regards to shape and energy.

			<em>Title: </em>To Myself (The Magic Shop) <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2020 <br>
			<em>Size: </em>60" &times; 80" &times; 70" <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Blanket, Cassette Tapes, Found Cloth, Pole, Chairs, Table, Pen, Notebook, Tape Recorder, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Audition, Adobe Illustrator <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Through this interactive exhibition, inspired by the psychodramatic "Magic Shop" technique where participants exchange negativity for encouragement, I wanted to create a safe space for visitors to connect with both their inner selves and with other participants. In this installation, which I created by sewing handwritten letters into a bedsheet with found fabric and cassette tape "thread," participants write letters to their past and future selves to send love and support, as well as to heal any past pains they may have inflicted on themselves. By exchanging their letters for another stranger’s, I hope to reveal to participants the universality in their struggles with self-love.

			<em>Title: </em>Gaze <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2021 <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Mirror, Bedsheets, Self, Adobe Photoshop, Nikon D3400 <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Despite the widespread dislike of shelter-in-place during the COVID era, working and studying from home counterintuitively provided a new perspective to how I experience the world around me. Utilizing my imagination and others’ artworks to delve into alternate universes on an everyday basis created another reality for me that would otherwise be unavailable in “normal” times, whether through capitalizing upon my newly available free time to experience culturally monumental novels and films, or even to appreciate the sunlight in my room that I never get to witness while attending in-person school in the mornings. The photo, which mimics voyeuristic paintings like Vermeer’s The Love Letter, treats the viewer as part of an external scene in yet another window, looking in at the subject’s exploration of new worlds.

			<em>Title: </em>Self-Construct <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2019 <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Nikon D3400, Adobe Photoshop <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			With three figures, this composition reflects upon my past middle-school self: struggling between not wanting to admit any possibility of her inferiority and ultimately doing so with increased bitterness out of her own self-hatred. Through the progression from left to right, the subject gradually gives into her insatiable desire to look at the mirror—to see herself for who she truly is—yet despite ultimately acknowledging her reflection, the subject still has not come to terms with her true self, constantly shielded from reality by her own self-constructed image.

			&mdash;<br>
			While I continue to develop a sense of identity, I often still find it difficult to summarize who I am in a few sentences when asked. The biggest part of who I am is probably my extracurriculars and passions, which include reading, photography, art, music, and ballet, but who I am outside of those activities is still something that feels unknown to me, no matter how hard I look.

			<em>Medium: </em>Vine Charcoal, White Conte, Eraser, Premiere Pro <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			As a collaboration with Astrid Schoenly, <em>Efflorescence</em> narrates the drifting apart of two childhood friends, reflecting upon a near-universal college experience of meeting, befriending, and losing contact with companions as time progresses.

			<em>Title: </em>Losing Contact <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2021 <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Contact Lens Cases, Ice, Paper Towel <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			This time lapse, which documents the melting process of ice in the shape of a pair of contact lenses, comments on the grief that accompanies losing touch with a close friend or relation. As one moves away from their original or previous home, they also tend to drift away from their old companions and ways of living; consequently, their unsuccessful attempts to reach out—as symbolized by the reaching and contracting tendrils of water in the napkin—ultimately lead to a sense of loss and impermanence as one loses loved ones that they may have had a special connection with. The ice especially creates a sense of loss of control, as one is unable to stop the melting and can only watch as it disappears, much like the gradual disconnect with others or the loss of a relationship.

			<em>Title: </em>[Be]longing <br>
			<em>Year: </em>2020 <br>
			<em>Medium: </em>Paint, Black Morphsuit, Projection <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			Through this project, I wanted to imply that one's imperfections are opportunities for both self-improvement and individuality, bringing up a topic that is often undercovered, even as mental illness becomes decreasingly stigmatized in the 21st century. Because black surfaces absorb light, I repurposed a common projection hindrance as an alternative portrayal of suppressed identity. The white paint that I smear across my face—which reflects the projector's light and “reveals” a distorted self-portrait—represents the process of acknowledging an unrealistically-disfigured self-image conjured from self-loathing.

			&mdash;<br>
			Inspired by the California fires that devastated a large number of people both this year and last year, I wanted to highlight another component of identity by creating a scrolling home inventory list, which is usually used for insurance purposes in the case of lost belongings due to natural disasters. 
			<br><br>
			Who we are is not only composed of the adjectives we describe ourselves with, the communities we're members of, and our day-to-day activities—it's also created from what we own, no matter how insignificant or worthless the object may be.

			Though dissimilar at first, both ballet and art are a means for self-expression. Even as I move onto new mediums, the lessons ballet has taught me in the balance of discipline and artistry will continue to influence my visual art and design processes.

			<em>Medium: </em>Bedsheet, Fabric, Thread, Sewing Machine, Organza, Chiffon, Tracing Paper, Embroidery Hoops, Air-Dry Clay, Wire <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			As an Asian American child, my relationship with my parents is often burdened by disconnects, not only in regards to the language barrier but also to cultural differences that dictate a child's duty and obligations to their parents. As a reversible jacket, the piece ponders children and parents as both containers and containees of each other, with both sides containing blank pieces of paper to represent both an inability for conversation and opportunities for communication.

			With what can almost be described as analog noise-canceling headphones, I sand-casted my hands and wrapped them with steel wire to create a wearable object that covers one's ears and creates a different auditory experience of the world.

			“If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.“ —Lao Tzu
			<br><br>
			Self-Sufficient Ecosystem represents a hypothetical future in which all humans, regardless of geographic location, must carry around oxygen-supplying tanks to survive in a planet where fresh air is no longer clean enough to breathe. In addition to exploring the idea of creating a self-sufficient, portable ecosystem, this piece serves as a warning to not only acknowledge the current effects of climate change, but also the devastating consequences of continuing in the same direction.

			<em>Medium: </em>Belt, Pencil Lead Cases <br>
			&mdash;<br>
			With an increasing number of school shootings in recent years, Bandolier represents the troubling statistics that reflect students’ roles in committing gun violence. Because stacked pencil lead cases resemble ammunition, I wanted to use the material in highlighting the conflicting themes of youth—symbolized by school and education—and maturity—manifested by violence and bloodshed—that exist as a result of poor communication with youths at risk and a lack of gun control.

			&mdash;<br>
			Passion to me is to love something so much, that despite endless hours of mental or physical labor, I still feel nothing but exhilaration. Whether in my schoolwork, ballet training, piano practice, or artistic endeavors, my passion combines with my workaholism to form a creative process that balances both pain and beauty.

			&mdash;<br>
			When on antidepressants for treatment, patients often need reminders to take their medicine; in this way, similar to the role a jacket plays, mental illness is something people will always carry with them. Whereas my parents always tell me, "Don't forget to take your jacket," oftentimes for people with mental illness the phrase becomes, "Don't forget to take your meds."
			<br><br>
			Alternatively, the inelasticity of the demand for various medications necessary for survival becomes more and more concerning as pharmaceutical companies continue to introduce aspects of consumer culture into a market where doing so could be potentially life-threatening.
