	statement: "After reading Philip Fisher's Wonder, the Rainbow, and the Aesthetics of Rare Experiences, I was interested in creating wonder in a mundane space. By creating a site-specific installation in my dorm room closets, I asked pairs of people to sit together in the same space for seven minutes, referencing the popular adolescent game Seven Minutes in Heaven, after confiscating their phones in an attempt to promote interaction. <br><br> The shared space seats two people due to how it was created by rearranging the two closets; after hot-casting a glass arch and splitting it in half to act as a lens for a galaxy projector light, I filled the space with a deep blue color and green particles. In addition to the light, I also hung broken pieces of found glass from hooks on the closet walls to further reflect the light and add to the atmosphere. <br><br> By inhabiting a familiar—yet unfamiliar, due to the wondrous atmospheric presence of the glass and light—space together for seven minutes, visitors of the installation are invited to overcome the awkwardness of being alone together without any distractions, nurturing conversation and interaction in a modern era where humans prefer to avoid complete vulnerability via their phones."
