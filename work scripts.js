Starting with seven different sets of templates for categories including one-time and multisession events, I completely redesigned the visual identity of the flyers to be more visually cohesive and ADA-compliant. Along with the designs themselves, I also carried out training in Canva to teach the Interpretation team not only how to use my system, but also how to navigate Canva itself for future design needs. The end result culminated in a 100+ page style guide detailing the templates, elements used in the templates, spacing, typography, Canva best practices, and FAQ's, among other details, as a way of documenting the entirety of the redesign and to provide details for future possible redesigns."

	statement: "Mesh employs repetition of a singular module in a linear pattern to create a surface that can be formed into a closed shape by connecting the two ends either forwards or backwards to create different silhouettes. The module is composed of a square that has been corner-notched and finger-braked to form a clover shape with four angled triangles on the corners; modules in the middle third of the mesh contain holes large enough for fingers to manipulate each subgroup within the pattern. Taking advantage of the rotation added in by hammered rivets, the pattern can lie flat and move flexibly as each module affects its connected siblings, allowing the entire piece to exist as both a three-dimensional object and a two-dimensional plane. As such, this gives rise to various possibilities of play in which the object can be interacted with as both a pliable flat material and a kaleidoscopic round form. The closure that connects the two ends of the mesh consists of two brass tubes that have been center-punched at their midpoints to allow the end modules to snap together at the narrower radii, which creates a visual detail to indicate the area of dis/connection while maintaining the same range of movement as the rivets."

	statement: "The object contains one dominant element and two subordinate elements, each repeated in a circular pattern. The dominant element consists of a square folded along diagonals to form a triangular module, which can be oriented in multiple ways along various axes of symmetry; these modules are linked together via the two subordinate elements, which are jump rings of two sizes. The composite object builds upon previous iterations, which all implemented different orientations of the dominant module, but also creates a more self-contained final product through radial symmetry, which is reflected in both the way everything is connected as well as in the subordinate elements themselves.  The interplay between the internal and external views also adds another aesthetic dimension, where viewers may have a certain expectation of how circular elements will interact with each other that can change depending on the angle from which they view the object. Additionally, the object also contains multiple degrees of movement, including rotation, opening/closing, and inward/outward tilting, which each come with their own unique sounds from contact between elements; this ultimately creates a more playful experience of messing with each individual piece to result in different ways of manipulating the object as a whole."

Even as children, our first experiences tend to center around finger-painting and Play-Doh, exemplifying the centrality of finger markmaking to the human experience. Using my fingers, I painted each rib, emphasizing the idea of the fingerprint as a mark in addition to the way my hands have sculpted the ribcage. With each rib ending in a miniature hand, the ribcage plays with surrealism and touch as a concept, as viewers imagine the ribcage initiating a hug of its own as well.'

In the same way, whenever we experience happy moments, we instinctively reach for our phones to take a photo and preserve the moment, though we know it will pass. Rather than trapping branches under fences to prevent their petals from being blown away (represented by the fence insert in the parasol), I wanted to remind both myself and others to stand under the umbrella and enjoy the moments for what they are."

As one moves away from their original or previous home, they also tend to drift away from their old companions and ways of living; consequently, their unsuccessful attempts to reach out — as symbolized by the reaching and contracting tendrils of water in the napkin — ultimately lead to a sense of loss and impermanence as one loses loved ones that they may have had a special connection with. The ice especially creates a sense of loss of control, as one is unable to stop the melting and can only watch as it disappears, much like the gradual disconnect with others or the loss of a relationship.

The white paint that I smear across my face — which reflects the projector's light and “reveals” a distorted self-portrait — represents the process of acknowledging an unrealistically-disfigured self-image conjured from self-loathing."
